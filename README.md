# Economic Complexity Index (ECI) Analysis in Sub-Saharan Africa

## Project Overview
This analysis uses PowerBI to examine the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), a metric measuring the sophistication of a country's economy based on the diversity and uniqueness of its exports. The analysis focuses specifically on Sub-Saharan African countries over the period from **1995 to 2018**.

## Understanding Economic Complexity Index (ECI)
- **High ECI (around 2 to 3)**: Indicates countries with diverse and sophisticated economies (e.g., Japan, Germany, Switzerland).
- **Low ECI (around -2 to -3)**: Indicates economies heavily reliant on a limited range of exports, typically primary commodities common in Sub-Saharan African countries.

## Geographical Scope
- Data covers **28 Sub-Saharan African countries**.
- Non-Sub-Saharan countries included in the raw dataset (e.g., Tunisia and Morocco) were noted but not the project's focus.

## Key Findings

### Top 5 Countries by ECI (1995-2018)
| Country Name        | Max ECI |
|---------------------|---------|
| Angola              | 9.38    |
| Botswana            | 5.85    |
| Burkina Faso        | 5.14    |
| Cameroon            | 4.63    |
| Congo, Dem. Rep.    | 4.24    |

### Bottom 5 Countries by ECI
| Country Name | Min ECI |
|--------------|---------|
| Togo         | 0.55    |
| Tunisia      | 0.53    |
| Uganda       | 0.51    |
| Zambia       | 0.50    |
| Zimbabwe     | 0.49    |

### Analytical Approach
- ECI progression analyzed via line charts, showing trends over 1995-2018.
- Annual growth rates calculated for Population, GDP, GDP per capita, and ECI.
- Visual correlation assessed between GDP and ECI to explore the hypothesis that higher GDP may correlate with higher ECI.

## Visualizations
- **Maps and heatmaps** indicating the geographic distribution of ECI.
- **Interactive dashboards** allowing filtering by country, income category, and time period.

## Impact and Applications
This analysis helps policymakers and researchers:
- Identify countries performing well in economic complexity, guiding economic diversification strategies.
- Recognize patterns linking economic growth (GDP) with economic complexity, influencing policy decisions to foster sustainable economic growth.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** PowerBI
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Excel
